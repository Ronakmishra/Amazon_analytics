## ‚ö° Tech Stack

## üöÄ What We Did

### Data Modeling & Preparation

- Imported raw Amazon sales and product data into Power BI.
- Used **Power Query** for cleaning (fixing types, removing nulls, renaming fields).
- Built a **data model** with proper relationships to support flexible analysis.

### KPI Design & DAX Measures

- Defined key business metrics using custom **DAX**:
- Sale Amount, Total Orders, Pending/Cancelled Orders, Shipped Orders, Return Rate, Total Products, Total Reviews, Average Product Rating, Inventory Left, Prime/Best Seller Product Share, etc.
- Applied formatting and logic to display zero instead of blanks for all KPIs.

### Dashboard Development

- Created **two main dashboards**:
    - **Orders Dashboard:** High-level KPIs, sales by region, sales trends, fulfillment/returns, category slicers.
    - **Product Analytics Dashboard:** Product-level KPIs, interactive catalogue, Prime/best seller share, category filters, advanced tooltips.
- Added **custom tooltips** with extra metrics and time-series visuals.
- Included slicers for category-based filtering.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight low stock or top performers.

### Visualization & Interactivity

- Used a mix of visuals (bar, line, pie, card, gallery) for maximum insight and presentation value.
- Enabled users to filter and drill-down with slicers, tooltips, and interactive visuals.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Model & DAX Examples

**Sample Measures:**
```dax
Sale_Amount = SUM(Amazon[Total Amount])
Total Orders = COUNT(Amazon[Order ID])
Pending Order = CALCULATE(COUNT(Amazon[Order ID]), FILTER(Amazon, Amazon[Status] = "pending"))
Cancelled Order = CALCULATE(COUNT(Amazon[Order ID]), FILTER(Amazon, Amazon[Status] = "Cancelled"))
Shipped orders = [Total Orders] - [Pending Order] - [Cancelled Order]
Return rate = DIVIDE([Cancelled Order], [Total Orders], 0) * 100

```
